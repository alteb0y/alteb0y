# 🎾 ATP Tennis Match Prediction  
(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-DwjXNaVlOD-57IDLZctsSkeTqF6ZBUv#scrollTo=eOIlSHhvgC-r)
An end-to-end **machine learning system** that predicts ATP tennis match outcomes using player statistics, rankings, and performance trends.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project scrapes real ATP match data and uses **machine learning models** to predict match winners.  
It integrates **player rankings, head-to-head records, surface performance, and recent form** into predictive models.  

---

## ⚡ Features  
✅ Web scraping of match data (Flashscore / ATP stats)  
✅ Feature engineering:  
   - Player ranking difference  
   - Head-to-head stats  
   - Surface win rate (hard, clay, grass)  
   - Recent form (last 5 matches)  
✅ Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest  
✅ Evaluation with accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
✅ Deployment-ready with Streamlit / FastAPI  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit / FastAPI (optional)
